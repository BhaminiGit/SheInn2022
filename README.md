Inspiration:
We wanted to create a website for an organization that works to promote cleanliness and recycling in Pittsburgh. We would be a non-profit organization that works with neighborhoods for funding. Our site would promote friendly competition between the neighborhoods to clean up and maintain cleanliness. Also, we wanted to include a way to give back to the community by offering prizes for the top scorers and top neighborhood such as gift cards to local restaurants, tickets to local museums, a buss pass, a neighborhood movie night, and free snacks. There are a lot of initiatives to encourage cleaning up Pittsburgh, but we wanted to create something that would give incentive for residents to keep their city clean.

What it does:
A user would log in and track their current progress in cleaning the city. They can access the individual leaderboard as well as the neighborhood leaderboard to monitor their ranking. The site also shows upcoming neighborhood clean-up events through a Google Calendar API. It also features an About Us section for participants to gain more insight on our project and why it's important. Participants are able to contact us through an email form.
